# Emotion-Detection-using-CNN-

This project presents an
advanced real-time facial emotion detection system designed to address these shortcomings,
offering a robust and user-friendly solution. Built using the Facial Expression Recognition (FER)
library with Haar Cascade face detection, the system accurately identifies emotions such as
happiness, sadness, anger, neutral, surprise, disgust, and fear from live webcam feeds. A Tkinterbased graphical user interface enhances accessibility, allowing users to seamlessly start/stop the
webcam and view emotion detection outputs, including bounding boxes around detected faces,
emotion labels with corresponding emojis, confidence scores, and a history of recent emotions.
